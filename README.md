Task manager
my app will help people plan their tasks.
I created this project as a technical task, but I liked the idea and made the project very quickly.
to run the project locally you need to install python, create a virtual environment and install django there
after that,you need open terminal and write python3 manage.py runserver
congratulations the project is launched

you can use the project as for notes, tasks or plans
